## About

This is a indie game made by me, you can put new levels, sounds, improve the scripts. draw all sprites in aseprite, scripts in c# and the engine is unity, I hope you like it since I did it with a lot of effort and I hope many people update and modify it to your liking.

I also say that it is my first game, so some scripts could be improved, and many sprites too.
