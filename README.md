## About

This is a indie game made by me, you can put new levels, sounds, improve the scripts. draw all sprites in aseprite, scripts in c# and the engine is unity, I hope you like it since I did it with a lot of effort and I hope many people update and modify it to your liking.

I also say that it is my first game, so some scripts could be improved, and many sprites too.

## Installation 

You can download the game here.

To modify it:

- Unity.
- Aseprite or other pixel art editor.
- IDE like visual studio.

## Game History

A girl suffers for sending personal photos, to someone who should not, even so her imagination does not stop and she has multiple adventures within her where she will realize that she can face whatever it is.

## Final Notes

- soon on steam and itchio.
- thanks to those who supported
